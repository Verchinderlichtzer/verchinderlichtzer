## About Me
- Learnt .NET since 2019 (with Visual Basic), and then moved to C# since 2022.
- I usually make projects with WinUI 3, Blazor Server and Blazor Hybrid WPF, but Desktop App is more preferable than Web App.
- Sprinkled with some knowledge of XAML, HTML and CSS.
- Other frameworks / techs I could work with are ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core (SQLServer and SQLite).
- Likes to be _alone_, often _alone_, and enjoys working _alone_.
- Just say good words or keep silent.

Sometimes I do a demonstration of my works on my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@rlvy).
